# Android-News
Ready for News is an android app that shows news using Api newsapi.org from The Hindu that shows about 12 news which keeps updating. Coding this project requires managing multiple Async tasks that can download simultaneous things at a time and some fascinating UI that uses custom adapter to populate list view. Very useful in practising your async and custom adapter android skills and can easily get you an A in school projects. If you like the app do give it a star and press the follow button.
